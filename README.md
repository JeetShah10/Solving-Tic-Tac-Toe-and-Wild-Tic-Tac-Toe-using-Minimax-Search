# Solving-Tic-Tac-Toe-and-Wild-Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Minimax-Search
* In this project, I aim to build two variations of tic tac toe.  
* The first one is tic tac toe where the first player plays x and the second player plays o. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all cells are used without someone getting a three in a row, the game is a draw.   
* The Second one is wild tic tac toe where on each turn a player can play either x or o. The player who gets the first three (x’s or o’s) in a row wins the game. If all cells are used without someone getting a three in a row, the game is a draw.  
* For experimenting I tried the Optimal Vs Optimal & Random Vs Optimal & User Vs Optimal function 100 times for both tic tac toe & wild tic tac toe.
